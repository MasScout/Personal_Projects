@ Purpose:  Show CS309 and CS413 students how to read user inputs from
@           the keyboard. Students are expected to learn ARM assembly in
@           these courses not obscure details about C printf and scanf.
@           In most cases it should be assumed the user provided a valid
@           input.

@ History: 
@    Date       Purpose of change
@    ----       ----------------- 
@   4-Jul-2019  Changed this code from using the stack pointer to a 
@               locally declared variable. 
@  15-Sep-2019  Moved some code around to make it clearer on how to 
@               get the input value into a register. 
@   1-Oct-2019  Added code to check for user input errors from the 
@               scanf call.   
@  21-Feb-2019  Added comments about "%c" vs " %c" related to scanf.
